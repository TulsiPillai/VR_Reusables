Reticle scripts and VR travel scripts
3D TRAVEL

Use the raycasting script for 3D travel using waypoints. Use the VR camera center as the cameraFacing variable. I've used Space type variable
to move the player on raycast as it is a room_scale VR experience. Use player.transfor if it's a mobile VR.

3D Manipulation

Use the switch script on every object that needs to be turned on and off. Basically, any object that is a light or a TV or a radio. 
The Virtual Switch script uses the action object that we provide in the switch script as a public variable. Action object specifies
what type of object is being switched on and off.
